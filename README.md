3. You are encouraged to first look at open requests to see if there is any match for your preferences. You can do so by clicking on an open issue to see the details and initiate a conversation with the issue creator (the person who opened the request) by commenting.

6. Once you submit the request, you can check in regularly on the buddy matcher  for comments from potential buddies. You will also be notified via the email address that you register for Github for all activities regarding issues that you have created or commented on. 

7. Once you have found a match, please visit the issue and click on **Close issue** or **Close with comment** to mark the request as resolved as soon as possible.

8. If your issue has not been resolved after a week, you can mention one of our moderators: **@anthonyhvo12 (Anthony Vo), @thle01 (Henry Le), @nghith95 (Nghi Truong), @** in a comment so that we can help facilitate the matching process. Please note that due to the high volume of activity on our tracker, we are unable to help with requests that are less than one week old.

9. A closed issue may be reopened if a pair stops collaborating for any reason and needs to look for a new buddy. You can reopen a new issue by clicking on Closed issues on the Issues tab. From there, you can search for your issue and click on **Reopen issue** or make a new comment and hit **Reopen and comment**
